When your application involves release and version management of some entity, this template has functions that can be useful. The template is centered around the support of a particular structure of entities that have specific relationships between eachother.

The entities involved in the pattern shown below are as follows:

| Entity | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| O  | **Object** - This is the main entity you are trying to manage in terms of versioning and release management. For instance, lets say your entity is called Widget. This would be the non-versioned Widget.|
| V  | **Version** - This represents a entity that tracks versions of the O entity. It would have attributes that need to be under version control. In our example, this would be a version of a Widget so might be named WidgetVersion.|
| VR | **Version Release** - This entity binds our O and V entities to a release. So  |
| R  | **Release** - This represents a release of one or more O,V pairs. |
| P  | **Parent** - This is an *optional* entity that defines a context for the R entity (as a parent entity to it). |


```
    +-------+    +-------+      +--------+        +-------+          +-------+
    |   P   +---<|   R   +-----<|   VR   |>-------+   V   |>---------+   O   |>--+
    +----+--+    +-------+      +--------+        +-------+          +----+--+   |
         |                            Y                                   |      |
         |                            +-----------------------------------+      |
         +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
Tag->           release:top    release:binder    release:version    release:object

```

These functions help support the detection of this pattern not just in terms of the tags but also the relationships between the entities.
